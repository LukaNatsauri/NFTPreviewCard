# NFT Preview Card

Created with CodeSandbox

This is the second html/css project that I've made, it was quite a challenge but through learning some new stuff I finally managed to finish it, looking forward for the next, more challenging projects.

I learned about proper centering of certain items or text, be it vertical, horizontal, or both. learned about hovering, cursor pointer and opacity. Understood that in order for an image and text to be inline, they must be inside of a div together. And many more stuff which will be perfected in practice.
